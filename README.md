This Ruby gem provides a CLI to interact with ESPN and receive current information regarding NFL teams. The user will be able to see the current record, roster, schedule and injury report for each team. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nfl_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nfl_cli

## Usage

Upon starting this gem you will be greeted with a list of all of the teams which you can receive information upon. You will make a selection based on the number associated with the team. After selecting a team, you will have the option to select additional teams, display the full list again or exit the program. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
